            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                I developed a simple educational arcade game for children aged 5-11 <br>
                 where the player tries to catch healthy food and escape from catching unhealthy sweets/fries. <br>
                The player can move in all directions by using the keyboard - catching the right NPC would add a score, <br>
                and catching the wrong NPC would appear little animation of a little boy gaining weight.<br>
                <br>
                The game is trying to educate players with visualizing and colorful entertainment. <br>
                The game is consider as a good practice and stimulates cognitive development as thinking (making a decision quickly), <br>
                exploring, and figuring things out. <br>
                The game ends once the little boy gets total weight and makes a sad face, <br>
                showing that eating unhealthy food could cause obesity in later stages and problems with mental health. <br>
                The player is made as a happy emoji to keep the attention of a younger audience. <br>
                The development was focused on attractive graphics, which were created in Adobe Illustrator 2022.
