         <h2>History of the Pygame</h2>
         <p>Pygame started in the summer of 2000. Being a C programmer of many years, <br>
            I discovered both Python and SDL at about the same time. You are already familiar with Python, which was at version 1.5.2. <br>
            You may need an introduction to SDL, which is the Simple DirectMedia Layer. Created by Sam Lantinga, <br>
            SDL is a cross-platform C library for controlling multimedia, comparable to DirectX. <br>
            It has been used for hundreds of commercial and open source games. <br>
            I was impressed at how clean and straightforward both projects were and it wasn't long before I realized mixing Python and SDL was an interesting proposal. <br>


            I discovered a small project already under-way with exactly the same idea, PySDL. <br>
             Created by Mark Baker, PySDL was a straightforward implementation of SDL as a Python extension. <br>
             The interface was cleaner than a generic SWIG wrapping, but I felt it forced a "C style" of code. <br>
             The sudden death of PySDL prompted me to take on a new project of my own. <br>
            
            I wanted to put together a project that really took advantage of Python. <br>
            My goal was to make it easy to do the simple things, and straightforward to do the difficult things.<br>
             Pygame was started in October, 2000. Six months later pygame version 1.0 was released.</p>
